2. Navigate to the directory: `ENSF380_Final_Project/JAVA`

3. Type the following command in terminal to *compile*:
```terminal
  javac -cp .;mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar edu/ucalgary/oop/main.java
```
4. Finally, write the following command in terminal to *run the program*:
```terminal
  java -cp .;mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar edu.ucalgary.oop.main
```

# # Running the Tests:
1. Navigate to the directory: `ENSF380_Final_Project/JAVA`

2. Type the following command in terminal to *compile*:
```terminal
  javac -cp .;junit-4.13.2.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar edu/ucalgary/oop/ProjectTest.java
```
3. Finally, write the following command in terminal to *run the program*:
```terminal
  java -cp .;junit-4.13.2.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore edu.ucalgary.oop.ProjectTest
```

# # Program Description:
The program will prompt you to enter the following information:
- The program will start with testing your already given schedule and it will give you an option to test your schedule
- If there are changes to be made, it will let you know that the changes are being made
